## Introduction to Domain
Since the Covid-19 pandemic has afftecd people lives in many ways, one of the things that might have afftected is taste in music. There are many factors that affect taste in music like dancebility,intenstiy etc. Our aim for this project is to analyze those factors and merge this analysis with covid dataset to identify how taste in music has changed.

## Research Question
How has Covid-19 changed the taste in music for spotify useres across different countries.

## Data and Source Description 
  1)https://spotifycharts.com/regional : To get the top charts from different regions.<br/>
  2)https://api.spotify.com : To get different paramaters of the songs through the api.<br/>
  3)https://www.kaggle.com/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset?select=dataset-of-00s.csv : A dataset of all the songs from the year 2000 to the year 2019.<br/>

## Future Work:
1. We can extend the work to "How different phases of lockdown affected the taste in music".
