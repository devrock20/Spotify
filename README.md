This project is part of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ITCS - 6162) course from University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

#### -- Project Status: [Pending]

## Introduction to Problem
Since the Covid-19 pandemic has affected people lives in many ways, one of the things that might have affected is preference in music. There are many factors that affect preference in music like danceability, intensity etc. Our aim for this project is to analyze those factors and merge this analysis with covid dataset to identify how preference in music has changed.

## Research Question
How has Covid-19 changed the preference in music for Spotify users across different countries.

## Data and Source Description 
  1)https://spotifycharts.com/regional : To get the top charts from different regions from previous weeks before and after the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>
  2)https://api.spotify.com : To get different features of the songs, such as genre and audio features, through the api.<br/>
  3)https://www.kaggle.com/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset?select=dataset-of-00s.csv : A dataset of all the songs from the year 2000 to the year 2019.<br/>
  4)Covid-19 data : https://covid19-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html : Use the open public Covid19 dataset hosted by aws 

  
## Future Work:
1. We can extend the work to "How different phases of lockdown affected the preference in music".
2. We could predict the top genres across different countries given the future scenario in terms of change in Covid-19 cases.
3. Identifying the preference in music after Covid-19 is over and comparing to the preference in music before and during Covid-19.
